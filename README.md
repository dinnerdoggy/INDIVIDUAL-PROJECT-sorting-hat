## About the User <!-- This is a scaled down user persona -->
- The ideal user for this application is a teacher employing some Harry Potter role play
- They have students in their classrooms that they would like to put into random groups and they have a love and passion of Harry Potter
- The problem this app solves for them is it allows them to get their students involved and excited about being in random groups. The students have felt that the groups have not been so random and based on favorites.

## Features
- When a new student is added an object is created and that object is pushed into an array of students that then prints to the DOM.
- House Colors: The color of the student's card changes depending on which house they were sorted.
- Card Ordering: Sorts the student cards alphabetically
- Voldermort's Army: A separate container of cards that hold the cards for students that have been expelled.
